Hi, I’m Brandon. I am double majoring in Math and Computer Science at Georgia Tech and a 3rd year student.

I’m interested in Machine Learning and Software Development. Right now, I know Java, Python, and MySQL. In Python, I am familar with many machine learning packages and have expiremented with a little deep learning. This semester, I am hoping to learn C programming
and dive deeper into data science. I hope to have completed project using C by the end of the semester.

Outside of school, I enjoy competing in Strongman and Powerlifting. I placed 1st the Novice Men's Middle Weight Class (231-) at Socastee's Strongest and came 2nd in the Open Men's Middle Weight Class (230-) at Titans of Titus. I also placed 1st at a powerlifting meet
but admittedly was the only competitor in my weight and age division.
