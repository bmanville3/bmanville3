Hi, I’m Brandon. I am double majoring in Math and Computer Science at Georgia Tech and am a 3rd year student.

I’m interested in Machine Learning and Software Development. Right now, I know Java, Python, and MySQL. This semester, I am learning C programming, diving deeper into ML, and hopefully learn a little about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Outside of school, I enjoy competing in Strongman and Powerlifting. I have placed first and second at a few meets.
