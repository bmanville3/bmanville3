Hi, I’m Brandon. I am double majoring in Math and Computer Science at Georgia Tech and a 3rd year student.

I’m interested in Machine Learning and Software Development. Right now, I know Java, Python, and MySQL. This semester, I am hoping to learn C programming and dive deeper into ML. I hope to complete a project using C by the end of the semester.

Outside of school, I enjoy competing in Strongman and Powerlifting. I placed 1st at Socastee's Strongest and came 2nd at Titans of Titus. I also placed 1st at a powerlifting meet but admittedly was the only competitor in my weight and age division.
